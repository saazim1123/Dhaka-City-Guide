            <p>With over 67 million internet cheap and available connections, Bangladesh has spawned a wave of tech-savvy youth whose initiatives are contributing to Bangladesh’s progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals besides the government innovations and interventions.</p>

            <p>Internet expansion has made Bangladesh the second most favorite country for freelancing according to the Oxford Internet Institute.      Ride-hailing tech companies stormed the Bangladeshi market with Uber, Pathao and Amar Ride launching services in Dhaka. Such initiatives have set a trend of using mobile apps to order a taxi or motorbike for either sole or shared travel.</p>

            <h2>Rickshaw</h2>
            <p>The most common public transport in Bangladesh is Rickshaw. Rickshaws are seen all over the country - in the capital city, big major cities, towns and rural areas and even in the hilly areas. In Bangladesh people hardly need to walk. Once you are outside of your home to a nearby road or a lane, one or more rickshaws will appear within a few minutes, with the little silver bell tinkling to get your attention.</p>

        <div class="cng cols">
            <img src="/images/transport/cng.jpg" alt="CNG">
            <h2>CNG</h2>
            <p>Auto rickshaws (locally called "CNGs" due to their fuel source, compressed natural gas) are one of the more popular modes of transport in Bangladesh mainly due to their size and speed. They are best suited to narrow, crowded streets, and are thus the principal means of covering longer distances within urban areas.</p>
